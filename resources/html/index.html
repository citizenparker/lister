    <h1>Start listing!</h1>
    <p>Lister is the world's simplest way to create and share lists of things! Really! I know everyone says this, but Lister <em>means</em> it from the bottom of its heart! So simple, it's stupid!</p>

      <h2>1. Start that List!</h2>
      <p>Click that beautiful button up there to start on your own wonderful list! Once you're there, you can add, complete, and clear things off that list! OH YEAH!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h2>2. Share that List!</h2>
      <p>Sharing a list couldn't be easier - just send the URL to someone! Yeah, that's it! No accounts, no security, no anything! The URLs are a little obscure so that you can't guess it, but that's it! So don't store the launch codes on Lister, that would be a bad idea!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h2>3. Never lose that URL!</h2>
      <p>How do you get to a list without the URL? You don't! So you should probably bookmark it if you plan on coming back to it in the future!</p>
